<H2 ALIGN=Center>INT 21,50 - Set Current Process ID  (Undocumented DOS 2.x)</H2>

<PRE>


	AH = 50h
	BX = process ID number (process <A HREF="program_segment_prefix.html">PSP</A> segment address)


	returns nothing


	- the process ID number is actually the segment address of a
	  program's PSP.  This is useful for TSR's to access their own
	  file handle table inside their PSP.
	- this function cannot be called while in an <A HREF="int_28.html">INT 28</A> handler in
	  DOS 2.x unless the critical error flag is set or stack corruption
	  will occur
	- safe in DOS 3.x INT 28 handlers since they use a different stack
	  by default
	- available in OS/2 compatibility box
	- see  <A HREF="int_21-51.html">INT 21,51</A>   <A HREF="int_21-62.html">INT 21,62</A>
