<H2 ALIGN=Center>INT 1C - System Timer Tick (User Routine)</H2>

<PRE>


	- called by <A HREF="int_8.html">INT 8</A>, approximately 18.206 times per second
	  (unless the program modifies the <A HREF="8253.html">8253</A> PIT
	- this is a user routine which the BIOS defaults to a simple <A HREF="iret.html">IRET</A>
	- this interrupt vector can be used for TSR popup utilities,
	  animated graphics updates and event polling
	- since many TSR's don't maintain the integrity of the interrupt
	  call chain, relying on this for TSR popup isn't recommended
