<H2 ALIGN=Center>INT 10,E - Write Text in Teletype Mode</H2>

<PRE>


	AH = 0E
	AL = ASCII character to write
	BH = page number (text modes)
	BL = foreground pixel color (graphics modes)


	returns nothing


	- cursor advances after write
	- characters BEL (7), BS (8), LF (A), and CR (D) are
	  treated as control codes
	- for some older BIOS (10/19/81), the BH register must point
	  to the currently displayed page
	- on CGA adapters this function can disable the video signal while
	  performing the output which causes flitter.
