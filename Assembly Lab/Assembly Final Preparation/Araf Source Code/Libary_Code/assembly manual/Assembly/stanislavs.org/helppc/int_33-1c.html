<H2 ALIGN=Center>INT 33,1C - Set Mouse Interrupt Rate  (InPort only)</H2>

<PRE>


	AX = 1C
	BX = rate code
	   = 0	no interrupts
	   = 1	30 interrupts per second
	   = 2	50 interrupts per second
	   = 3	100 interrupts per second
	   = 4	200 interrupts per second



	- work with the InPort mouse only
	- sets the rate the mouse status is polled by the mouse driver
	- faster rates provide better resolution but take away CPU time
	- values in BX > 4 can cause unpredicatable results
